Sitemate challenge

THE BELOW IS FOR SIMPLICITY, normally I WOULD NOT put in my environment variable but just for simplicity of the marker
In backend make a .env file and put in the following:
PORT = 5000
MONGODBURL = "mongodb+srv://root:qSGvK09kXSo7fLXM@issue.kryfhbu.mongodb.net/issues-collection?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Issue"

Clone this repo

1. run `npm install`
2. create a .env file as mentioned above
3. run `npm start`

In a separate terminal
Frontend:

1. go to frontend `cd frontend`
2. run `npm install`
3. Get tailwind on vite
